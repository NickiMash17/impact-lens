# Impact Lens — 2-Minute Demo Script

## Opening (15 seconds)

**"Most decision tools optimize for one metric. Real decisions create trade-offs."**

*[Pause for effect]*

**"Impact Lens is a decision trade-off simulator. It helps you explore the real-world consequences of complex choices—before you commit."**

---

## Core Demo (90 seconds)

### Step 1: Set Context (10 seconds)

**"We're looking at renewable energy investment allocation. One decision lever: what percentage of the budget goes to renewables?"**

*[Point to slider]*

**"Watch what happens when we change this single variable."**

---

### Step 2: The Unforgettable Moment (30 seconds)

**"Let's move from 35% to 55%."**

*[Move slider slowly, let metrics animate]*

**"Notice: carbon reduction improves. Jobs increase. But look—energy costs rise, and grid stability dips."**

*[Point to specific metrics]*

**"This is the transition zone. Some metrics improve while others degrade. That's the decision tension."**

*[Pause]*

**"The system is honest about this. See the trade-off signal?"**

*[Point to TradeOffSignal component]*

**"It says: 'System under transition stress.' Most tools hide this. We surface it."**

---

### Step 3: AI Explanation (20 seconds)

**"The AI explains what changed and why—not what to do, but what's happening."**

*[Point to InsightPanel]*

**"Notice the language: 'appears to be,' 'suggests,' 'may.' It's uncertain. This is a simulation, not a prediction."**

---

### Step 4: Time Horizon (20 seconds)

**"The timeline shows the 10-year trajectory."**

*[Point to TimelineChart]*

**"Short-term costs, medium-term instability, long-term gains. This helps you weigh immediate pain against long-term benefit."**

---

### Step 5: Comparison Mode (10 seconds)

**"You can lock two scenarios and compare them side-by-side."**

*[Quick toggle to comparison mode if time permits]*

**"This is useful for stakeholder communication—explaining why certain trade-offs were chosen."**

---

## Closing (15 seconds)

**"Impact Lens doesn't tell you what to do. It shows you what happens. It makes trade-offs visible, immediate, and honest."**

*[Pause]*

**"That's what decision-making should feel like: informed, transparent, aware of consequences."**

## Practice Tips

1. **Move the slider slowly** — Let judges see the animations
2. **Point to specific metrics** — Make the trade-offs visible
3. **Pause after key moments** — Let it sink in
4. **Use the exact phrases** — They're tested
5. **Stay calm** — Confidence, not hype

## Backup Plan (If Something Breaks)

**"Let me show you the concept..."**

*[Explain the idea even if UI fails]*

**"The core idea is making trade-offs visible. Most tools optimize one metric. We show the full picture—the tensions, the trade-offs, the reality of complex decisions."*
